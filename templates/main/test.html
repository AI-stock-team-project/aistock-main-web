	Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ JANG-goh; sometimes stylized as django)[6] is a Python-based free and
						open-source web framework that follows the model–template–views (MTV) architectural
						pattern.[7][8] It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an American independent
						organization established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

						Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The
						framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling,
						rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself.[9] Python is used throughout,
						even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative
						create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection
						and configured via admin models.
